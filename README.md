Detecting Geometrical Shapes in an image using OpenCV

We will see that how we can detect shapes using cv2 in an image using contours and moments.



Approach : The approach we would use to detect the shape of a given polygon will be based on classifying the detected shape on the basis of a number of sides it has. For example, if the detected polynomial has 3 sides, then it could be considered as a triangle, if the polynomial has 4 sides then it could be classified as a square or a rectangle, and so on.
